## General info
A front end project, I wanted to use a better folder structure with mutiple modules. It has no API calls but services are used anyway to 
understand better how can I use them to transfer any kind of data. 
* Check out the final result [Here](https://angular-food-app.vercel.app/).  (Free server, it may take a bit to load the first time)

## Features

* Search for foods by name.

* using ActiveRoute to fill the home page depending on the food name in the url params.
